# CarbonDiversity


## Description

### This project, built in p5.js is meant to be approximate demonstration on how diversity within a forested ecosystem can effect carbon.  Please note: this project may not work in internet explorer.

## Features 

### GUI Tool

####  The basis for the gui can be found [here](https://github.com/bitcraftlab/p5.gui) with easy instructions on how to use it. It was a great tool to show and allow variable numbers of arrays of trees. 

### Trees/ Artwork

#### I used photographs of the specific trees as reference and hand drew them using color pencils. I took pictures of the drawings and then altered them using Adobe Photo Editor. The background was a simply sketch of a dark mountains edited to have a more purplish glow. Then used Adobe tools to draw the forest floor. Carbon was made in the same way. 

### classes of Trees

### In order to make the trees look uniform on the page - I had to specifically alter a few of them. I had some trouble getting the cedar, specifically, to look more natural (it still doesn't) so I used adobe to cut the image up and overlay it's pieces on the page to help it better co-exist. Putting the trees in separate pages allowed for the main logic to look a lot cleaner and easier to follow as well. 

  
## Usage
### This tool is meant to be a visual demonstration of a scientific principal.
